# Architectural decisions

A log of every non-obvious design choice in MinDB, in the order a reader
would hit them working top-down through the system: concurrency, memory
layout, the search algorithm, quantization, durability, and the wire
protocol. Each entry is **decision → why → what it cost**. Where a decision
reversed an earlier one, the earlier approach and why it was rejected is
included, because the rejection is often more instructive than the choice.

This complements [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), which is the
narrative design doc with measurements; this file is the flat list, meant to
be skimmed or grepped.

## Concurrency

### Decision: one `sync.RWMutex`, held across the whole scan

**Why:** `RLock`/`RUnlock` costs ~20 ns; a search costs ~1–6 ms. The lock is a
rounding error next to the work it protects, so there is nothing to win by
avoiding it.

**Rejected alternative: lock-free reads via tombstoning + RCU compaction.**
This was the original design and it was implemented far enough to reveal
three real bugs before being thrown out:

1. **Hard crash.** `idMap` is a plain Go map. Two concurrent `Insert`s, or an
   `Insert` racing a `Delete`, hit the Go runtime's `concurrent map read and
   map write` — an unrecoverable *throw*, not a `panic`. The process dies.
2. **Silent corruption.** `Insert` wrote `dims` float32s into the vector array
   and then flipped a `live` bit, with no memory barrier between the two. A
   concurrent searcher could read a half-written vector and return a
   plausible *wrong* score — no error, no crash, just a bad answer.
3. **Lost writes.** RCU compaction built a fresh copy of the engine in the
   background and swapped a pointer. Writes landing on the *old* copy during
   the swap vanished. Real RCU is "lock-free readers, synchronized writers" —
   it never promised lock-free writers, and the design had quietly assumed it
   did.

There was also a fourth problem that wasn't a bug so much as a wasted
subsystem: capacity is preallocated, so compaction never actually reclaimed
memory — it only made the live set denser. An entire background goroutine,
a second full copy of the engine, and a transient 2x memory spike existed to
solve a problem a ten-line free list solves with zero concurrency exposure.

**Cost of the RWMutex approach:** a writer waits behind an in-flight scan.
Concurrent searches still run fully in parallel — `RLock` is shared, only
`Lock` (writes) is exclusive. For a read-dominated sidecar this is the right
trade, and unlike the lock-free version it is *actually correct*.

---

### Decision: replace RCU compaction with a free list

**Why:** capacity is fixed and preallocated at `New(dims, capacity)`, so
"compaction" was never reclaiming memory — the backing arrays are the same
size before and after. A `Delete` pushes the freed slot index onto
`e.free []uint32`; the next `Insert` pops from it before growing
`highWater`. No background goroutine, no second copy, no pointer swap.

**Consequence:** a vector's internal slot index is *not* stable — deleting
and re-inserting can reuse a slot. External IDs are stable; slots are an
implementation detail (`pkg/core/engine.go`, `idMap`).

---

## Memory layout

### Decision: struct-of-arrays (`Engine` holds parallel slices, not `[]Vector`)

**Why:** a scan only needs `vectors` (or `codes`+`scales`+`residuals` for the
cascade) — it never touches `externalID` or `payloads` until after top-k is
decided. Struct-of-arrays means every cache line the scan pulls in from
`vectors` is 100% useful data, versus array-of-structs where each cache line
would carry ID and payload bytes the hot loop doesn't need.

**Cost:** more bookkeeping arrays to keep in sync (`live`, `idMap`, `free`,
`highWater` all have to agree), and `Delete` has to touch several slices
instead of one. Justified because the scan is the operation being optimized
for; deletes are comparatively rare and cheap regardless.

### Decision: normalize every vector to unit length at insert

**Why:** if `‖v‖ = ‖q‖ = 1`, cosine similarity **is** the dot product — no
division, no magnitude array, no extra random-access load in the hot loop.
It is also a *precondition* of the cascade's error bound (see below):
Cauchy-Schwarz gives `|q·(v−v̂)| ≤ ‖q‖·ρ`, and that collapses to `≤ ρ` only
because `‖q‖ = 1`.

**Cost:** one `Normalize` pass at insert (`O(dims)`, done outside the lock)
and one at query time. `Insert` copies the caller's vector before
normalizing so the caller's slice is never mutated
(`pkg/core/engine.go:Insert`).

### Decision: bounded min-heap for top-k, not a sort

**Why:** sorting all live scores is `O(n log n)` plus an allocation for `n`
in the tens of thousands — enough to erase the gains from everything else.
A size-`k` min-heap (`pkg/core/engine.go:topK`) does `O(log k)` work per
candidate and the common case (`score` below the current worst survivor) is
one predictable branch that rejects the candidate outright. Heaps are pooled
per-worker via `sync.Pool` and merged after a parallel scan.

### Decision: parallel scan across `GOMAXPROCS`, gated by a size threshold

**Why:** fan-out and per-worker heap merge cost more than they save below
`parallelScanThreshold = 8192` live vectors (`pkg/core/engine.go`), so small
engines scan on a single goroutine. Above that, the corpus is split into
contiguous chunks, each worker gets a pooled heap, and the heaps are merged
at the end.

### Decision: ties break on slot index during scan, on external ID during presentation

**Why:** parallelizing the scan means candidates with equal scores can arrive
in different orders depending on how many workers ran, so the heap's
internal tiebreak (lower slot wins, `worse()` in `engine.go`) exists purely
to make output deterministic regardless of `GOMAXPROCS` — the differential
test compares scores exactly and would otherwise be flaky. The *final*
sort in `Search` breaks ties on external ID instead, because slot indices
are not stable across a snapshot reload and IDs are.

---

## Search: the bound-and-refine cascade

### Decision: store both a float32 vector and an int8 quantized copy, plus a residual norm

**Why:** this is the core idea of the project. Alongside the exact float32
vector, every insert also computes an int8 code, a per-vector scale, and a
residual norm `ρ = ‖v − v̂‖` (`pkg/math/quantize.go:Quantize`). A search first
scores every vector cheaply against its int8 code (a quarter of the bytes),
then uses `ρ` to get a *hard* two-sided bound on the true score via
Cauchy-Schwarz — not a heuristic estimate. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for
the full derivation.

**Why this differs from Qdrant/Weaviate/Milvus-style quantization:** those
systems score with compressed codes, oversample by a constant factor,
rescore, and hope the true top-k survived — recall is a property you
*measure*, not one you're guaranteed. MinDB's pruning is provably lossless:
a vector is discarded only when it is mathematically impossible for it to be
in the top-k. The result is bit-identical to brute force, and a differential
test in `pkg/core/cascade_test.go` (`TestCascadeIsExact`) asserts exactly
that across thousands of random queries.

### Decision: asymmetric scoring — the query is never quantized

**Why:** an earlier version considered quantizing both sides (symmetric
scoring), which was found unsound: the error bound would need to account for
error in *both* the query and the database vector, which is a much looser
bound and, worse, was derived incorrectly in the first pass (documented as a
retired claim in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`). Keeping the query in float32 means
the only error term is the stored vector's own residual, giving a
measurably tighter bound (4.3x, per `ARCHITECTURE.md`) — and it means the
SIMD kernel only needs `VPMOVSXBD`/`VCVTDQ2PS`/`VFMADD231PS` (AVX2 + FMA3),
not the AVX-512 VNNI instructions that true int8×int8 dot products need.

### Decision: residual norm is measured directly, not derived from the scale

**Why:** an earlier version computed `‖v̂‖ = √(1 − ρ²)`, which assumes the
quantization residual is orthogonal to the reconstruction. int8 rounding is
not an orthogonal projection, so that identity is only approximate — and an
approximate bound isn't a proof. `Quantize` now does one extra pass at
insert time to measure `ρ` directly (`pkg/math/quantize.go`). Cost: one
extra `O(dims)` pass per insert, never at query time.

### Decision: guard fallback to a plain float32 scan when survivors exceed 25% of the corpus

**Why:** the cascade's win depends on most vectors being prunable in pass 1.
If pass 2's survivor set gets large, pass 3 (scattered exact rescoring, which
walks the float32 array out of order and runs serially) can end up costing
more than a straight parallel float32 scan would have. `guardFraction = 0.25`
(`pkg/core/cascade.go`) was set from `BenchmarkGuardCrossover`, which found
the crossover (scattered rescore alone equalling a full scan) at ~49%
survivors on this machine; 0.25 sits at the cautious end of the plausible
range once the bound pass itself is accounted for. Both paths return
identical results, so getting this constant wrong only costs time, never
correctness — and in practice it's nearly unreachable, since clustered data
measures ~0.4% survivors, two orders of magnitude under the threshold.

### Decision: the cascade only activates when `math.HasFastInt8()` is true

**Why:** pure-Go int8 dot products plateau at ~0.83 G MAC/s — Go cannot emit
the packed multiply-accumulate instruction that makes int8 arithmetic pay
off, across every unroll factor tried (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`). Without SIMD,
scoring int8 codes is *slower* than just scanning float32 directly, so
taking the cascade path would make searches slower, not faster.
`Engine.useCascade` defaults to `math.HasFastInt8()` and can be overridden
per-engine via `SetCascade` for benchmarking.

## The AVX2 kernel (stage 3)

### Decision: generate the assembly with Avo rather than hand-write it

**Why:** hand-written Plan9 assembly is easy to get subtly wrong (register
allocation, calling convention, stack frame size) and hard to review. Avo
(`github.com/mmcloughlin/avo`) is a Go DSL that emits Plan9 assembly plus a
matching Go stub, so the source of truth
(`pkg/math/avo/asm.go`) is normal, readable Go, and the generated
`pkg/math/dotint8_avx2_amd64.s` / `..._stub.go` are committed artifacts
regenerated via `go run asm.go -out ... -stubs ...`.

**Why AVX2 + FMA3, not AVX-512:** AVX2 is available on every x86-64 CPU since
Haswell (2013) / Zen (2017); AVX-512 is absent on most consumer Zen ≤3 parts
and disabled on Intel's hybrid consumer lineups, and suffers downclocking on
several server parts. Because scoring is asymmetric (query stays float32),
the kernel never needs int8×int8 multiply, which is the operation AVX-512
VNNI exists for — `VPMOVSXBD` (sign-extend 8×int8 → 8×int32) +
`VCVTDQ2PS` (convert → float32) + `VFMADD231PS` (multiply-accumulate against
the float32 query) covers it entirely on AVX2.

**Why `golang.org/x/sys/cpu` for detection, not a `cpuid` call written by
hand:** it's already an indirect dependency (pulled in by gRPC's transitive
graph) and is the standard, well-tested way to read CPUID flags in Go.
`pkg/math/kernel_amd64.go`'s `init()` checks `HasAVX2 && HasFMA && HasAVX`
and only then swaps `dotInt8Impl` to the generated kernel; every other
platform (including non-amd64 entirely, via `kernel_generic.go`) falls back
to `dotInt8Generic`, so MinDB is correct everywhere and fast where the
hardware allows it.

**Why Avo is declared as a `tool` dependency in `go.mod`, not a normal
`require`:** the generator (`pkg/math/avo/asm.go`) carries a
`//go:build ignore` tag so it's excluded from every normal build — otherwise
`go build ./...` would see two `package main`/`package math` files fighting
over the same directory. Because nothing in the buildable graph imports Avo,
`go mod tidy` would otherwise drop it from `go.mod` entirely, breaking
regeneration for the next person. Go 1.24's `tool` directive
(`go get -tool github.com/mmcloughlin/avo/build`) pins it explicitly for
exactly this case: a dependency only `go run`/`go generate` needs, never
`go build`.

**Measured impact** (this machine, `BenchmarkSearchPaths`, N=20,000,
dims=768): brute force 6.47 ms, cascade with the AVX2 kernel active 1.75 ms
— a real, measured 3.7x, not a projection. The raw kernel itself sustains
~23.5 GB/s at 768 dims, comfortably above this machine's ~11.7 GB/s memory
bandwidth, meaning the int8 scan is now bandwidth-bound rather than
compute-bound — exactly the point of writing the assembly in the first
place.

---

## Durability

### Decision: `tmp → fsync → rename → fsync(parent dir)`, not a direct overwrite

**Why:** without the final directory fsync, the rename itself is not
guaranteed durable — a power loss right after `rename()` can leave the
directory entry pointing at the old file, or nowhere, even though the file's
own bytes are safely on disk. This is the step most homegrown atomic-write
implementations skip. (`pkg/core/snapshot.go:Save`)

**Windows caveat, documented rather than worked around:** Windows has no
directory-fsync equivalent, so `syncDir` is a no-op there
(`runtime.GOOS == "windows"`). Development happens on Windows; deployment
does not have to. Worth knowing rather than pretending the guarantee holds
everywhere.

### Decision: int8 codes are not persisted in the snapshot

**Why:** only the float32 vector is written to disk; codes, scales, and
residuals are recomputed by `store()` on load. Persisting them would grow
the file ~25% for a re-quantization cost (~300 ms at 100k×768) that's noise
next to reading hundreds of MB off disk — and, more importantly, it decouples
the on-disk format from the quantization scheme, so a future change to how
codes are built doesn't invalidate every snapshot already written.

### Decision: `Load` calls the internal `store()`, not the public `Insert()`

**Why:** `Insert` normalizes its input. A snapshot already contains
normalized vectors (they were normalized once, at the original insert); if
`Load` re-normalized them, float32 rounding means the norm computes as
`1 ± 1e-7` rather than exactly 1, and dividing by that shifts the vector's
low bits. Scores computed after a reload would then differ subtly from
scores computed before it — a snapshot round-trip should be invisible to a
caller, and this was the fix that made it so.

---

## Wire protocol

### Decision: FlatBuffers over gRPC, with a genuinely zero-copy read path for vectors

**Why:** the generated FlatBuffers accessor reads one `float32` per call
through bounds-checked offset arithmetic — correct, but it copies element by
element. `pkg/api/grpc_server.go:float32Vector` instead validates the vector
region once and then reinterprets the wire buffer directly via
`unsafe.Slice`, which is safe here because FlatBuffers' wire format is
already little-endian 4-byte-aligned float32 — exactly what a `[]float32` on
a little-endian platform looks like in memory. A `nativeLittleEndian` runtime
check guards a byte-swapping fallback for the (currently theoretical, since
Go's amd64/arm64 targets are all little-endian) big-endian case, rather than
assuming it.

**Honesty about "zero-copy":** it's true for reading a request and false for
building a response — gRPC still marshals whatever the handler returns, and
constructing a `flatbuffers.Builder` for a `SearchResponse` still allocates.
The docs say which half is real rather than claiming the whole thing.

### Decision: `grpc.ForceServerCodec(flatbuffers.FlatbuffersCodec{})` is mandatory, not optional

**Why:** the RPC handlers return `*flatbuffers.Builder`, not a generated
protobuf struct, so gRPC's default codec cannot marshal the response — this
fails at **request time**, not at compile time, if the codec isn't
registered. `cmd/mindb-server/main.go` calls this out explicitly at the
`grpc.NewServer(...)` call site because it's the kind of thing that works in
every test that constructs the server directly and only breaks over the
wire.

### Decision: `Insert` batches are not transactional

**Why:** the engine has no transaction log or rollback mechanism, so if
vector 5 of a 10-vector `Insert` request fails validation, vectors 0–4 are
already stored and stay stored — the RPC just returns an error naming which
vector failed and how many were stored before it
(`pkg/api/grpc_server.go:insertError`). Pretending otherwise (silently
rolling back) would require machinery the engine doesn't have and that a
sidecar with this scale target doesn't need; documenting the real behavior
was cheaper and more honest than building it.

## What was tried and explicitly rejected

Kept here so nobody re-proposes them without knowing why they didn't work.

- **AVX-512 on the float32 path.** A plain unrolled-by-8 Go loop already
  sustains ~13 GB/s per core against an ~11.7 GB/s memory subsystem — there
  is nothing left for SIMD to win when the loop is already waiting on DRAM.
  Assembly only pays for itself on the int8 path, where pure Go is
  compute-bound rather than memory-bound.
- **4-bit quantization.** Its error bound is technically valid, but wide
  enough that it prunes almost nothing — the 8x compression bought a full
  scan followed by a full rescore, which is strictly worse than just
  scanning float32 once. Measured, then deleted.
- **Plain sign-bit (1-bit) quantization.** The fastest possible scan
  (~1 ms for 100k vectors) but recall collapses on clustered data
  (`recall@10 ≈ 0.63` even with a 1000-candidate shortlist), because
  vectors that share a cluster also share most of their sign bits — Hamming
  distance can't discriminate exactly where the top-k lives. Deferred to a
  future rotated-quantization (RaBitQ-style) approach rather than shipped
  broken; tracked as stage 4 in the roadmap.
