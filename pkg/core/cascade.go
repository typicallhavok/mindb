// guardFraction is the survivor rate above which the cascade abandons its
// shortlist and runs a plain float32 scan instead.
//
// Measured by BenchmarkGuardCrossover at 20k x 768 on this machine: scattered
// rescoring alone equals a full parallel scan at f ≈ 49%. That is the ceiling,
// and it is well under the ~75% a bytes-moved argument predicts, for two
// reasons — rescoring walks the float32 array out of order, and pass 3 is
// serial while the scan is parallel.
//
// The real threshold is that ceiling minus the bound pass, which cannot be
// measured honestly until the AVX2 kernel exists: at a quarter of a float32
// scan the crossover is ~34%, at half it is ~22%. 0.25 sits inside that range,
// deliberately at the cautious end, because setting it too low costs only the
// thin margin near the crossover while setting it too high means paying for
// both passes. Re-measure in stage 3.
//
// Getting it wrong is bounded either way: results are identical, only the time
// changes. In practice it is nearly unreachable — clustered data measures 0.4%
// survivors, two orders of magnitude below the threshold.
var guardFraction = 0.25

// searchCascade returns the top k using bound-and-refine, and reports how many
// vectors survived pruning. A survivor count equal to the live count means the
// guard fired and a full float32 scan ran instead.
//
// The algorithm, and why it cannot drop a correct answer:
//
//  1. Score every vector against its int8 code. With a float32 query the only
//     error term is that vector's residual, so [approx−ρ, approx+ρ] is a hard
//     bound on the true score.
//  2. Let τ be the k-th largest lower bound. At least k vectors have a true
//     score ≥ τ, so the k-th largest true score is itself ≥ τ.
//  3. Therefore every member of the true top-k has a true score ≥ τ, and since
//     hi ≥ true, every member has hi ≥ τ. Discarding hi < τ is safe.
//  4. Rescore the survivors exactly.
//
// Caller must hold at least the read lock.
